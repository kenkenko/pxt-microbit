甚麼是 micro:bit?
2015年，英國廣播有限公司（BBC）開始推出 micro:bit，用以教授學生電腦科學。BBC 向所有英國的 7 年級學生分發一部 micro:bit。你可以視 micro:bit 為一部微型電腦。http://microbit.org

## 電腦是甚麼
電腦可以分成以下 4 個主要部分:

1. 處理器 – 通常是電腦內一粒很小的晶片，而處理器就是電腦處理和轉化資料的關鍵。大家都聽過｢CPU」吧！CPU 就是中央處理器（Central Processing Unit）。處理器就好像電腦內的大腦 - 處理器越快，電腦的速度也越快。

2. 記憶體 – 電腦就是這樣記住東西 There are two types of memory:
>* RAM (random access memory) - you can think of this as the computer’s short-term memory
>* Storage (also referred to as the “hard drive”) - this is the computer’s long-term memory, where it can store information even when power is turned off

3. Inputs – this is how a computer takes in information from the world.  On humans, our input comes in through our senses, such as our ears and eyes. What are some Computer Inputs?  Keyboard, Mouse, Touchscreen, Camera, Microphone, Game Controller, Scanner

4. Outputs – this is how a computer displays or communicates information.  On humans, we communicate information by using our mouths when we talk. What are some examples of communication that don't involve talking?  Blushing, sign language. What are some examples of Computer outputs?  Monitor/Screen, Headphones/Speakers, Printer

Now, let’s look at our micro:bit:

* Use the diagram here as a visual aid: http://microbit.org/hardware/ 
* Can you find the Processor?
* How much memory does the micro:bit have? 16K, which is smaller than many files on your computer!
* Can you locate the following Inputs?  Buttons (on board), Pins (at base), Accelerometer / Compass.
>Note: Though not pictured, the Light Sensor is located on the LED lights
* Where are the Outputs?  LED lights, Pins

All computers need electricity to power them.  There are 3 ways to power your micro:bit:
* Through the USB port at the top
* By connecting a battery pack to the battery connector
* Through the 3V Pin at the bottom (not the recommended way to power your micro:bit)

On the top left corner you may notice that your micro:bit has a Bluetooth antenna.  This means your micro:bit can communicate and send information to other micro:bits.  We will learn more about this feature in the Radio Lesson.
